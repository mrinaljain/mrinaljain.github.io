# Intercepted Routes

Intercepted routs give us ability to show routes from other place/ folder while keeping our routes intact.


# Rules
- decide source and target folder
   - Source is from where you are redirecting
   - Target is where you are redirection/ intercepting

- create a intercepted folder by the name of target in source folder
- update the name of  intercepted folder using path convention
   - (.)
   - (..)
   - (..)(..) :
   - (...) : Starts from Root directory
